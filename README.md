# Infinite-storage
infinite storage store any file as a form of video on you tube.


this project is simple this project is work as like dropbox.  I do not endorse high volume use of this tool. in this code there are several bugs that limit the use like the poor use of RAM limiting
and cpu uasge.

## what this project do ?

this project convert any file into video and you can upload it on you tube and when you need your file then you download from you tube and decode this video and get your original data.


## How to use this ?

### step 1

open endcode.py file and write filename which you want to compress also you can change other perameres.

in this process it will create images in data folder.

### setp 2

now you run video.py file and create images to video.

you get mp4 video formate , now you just upload this video on you tube.


### step 3

now when you want your file back at that time you first run vide_to_frame.py file and than run decode.py file.


### Note

this process create one key.txt file this file shows all parameres and you can change it accoding to your requirement. when you decode your video at that time you pass this file parameter in script. read comment carefully and understnd the meaning of it other wise you get some error. ( you just comment print statemet for achiving high speed).

So, download this files and create your data into videos.
